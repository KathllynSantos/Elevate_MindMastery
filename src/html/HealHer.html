        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Welcome to your course HealHer. This course is divided into 10 modules.</p>
        <h2>Module 1</h2>
        <p>Inner Child Healing & Shadow Work is a transformative journey of self-awareness and emotional healing. By recognizing childhood wounds through mindfulness and journaling, we uncover deep-seated fears and patterns. Communicating with your inner child and reparenting yourself fosters self-love and resilience. Daily self-care and emotional awareness strengthen healing. Embracing this process leads to authenticity, empowerment, and a fulfilling life. </p>
