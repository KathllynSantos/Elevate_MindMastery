        <section class="course-overview"><h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to your course HealHer. This course is divided into 10 modules.</p>
            <h2>Module 1</h2>
            <p>This journey is a beautiful and transformative exploration of self-discovery and emotional healing. We begin by reconnecting with our inner child, using practices like meditation and compassionate listening to heal past wounds. We then gently confront past traumas, taking it one step at a time and recognizing when professional support is needed. Reparenting ourselves through self-care and nurturing creativity becomes an essential tool in honoring our inner child. To maintain emotional health, we learn to set healthy boundaries and engage in ongoing self-reflection. When challenges arise, we embrace our emotions with kindness and practice self-compassion while building resilience. Each lesson is an invitation to transform, empowering us to deepen our personal growth and emotional healing. This is a journey of patience, self-love, and the beautiful process of embracing who we truly are.</p>
            <h2>Module 2</h2>
            <p>The THRIVER'S Masterclass with Kylie Hanna helps you break toxic relationship patterns and build healthier connections. Discover your love language (Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Acts of Service, Physical Touch, Receiving Gifts) and understand attachment styles (Secure, Anxious, Avoidant, Fearful). Use affirmations to improve relationships, set healthy boundaries, and resolve conflicts with expert guidance and ebooks. Start thriving in love and life!</p>
